1. We will first look at general topics that are important, and then see how we can apply these to an actual project.
    - Day 1 will focus on concepts; you can then research more between sessions.
    - Day 2 will apply these concepts to a mini-project.
2. This webapp will stay live; however, I may update it and change the content going forward. Since it is on GitHub, you will be able to find older versions and can `fork` your own copy to snapshot it. Feel free to download the presentation pdfs.
3. This is intended as a life-raft to researchers adrift in a sea of messy code. We will be focusing on *good-enough* software dev practises, not *best* practices, because...

### Anything worth doing well, is worth doing poorly at first!

Perfectionism is the enemy of progress, and a bunch of other clichÃ©s.

- Sometimes online software development tutorials or articles assume you are starting from scratch in a completely new clean project, and don't give you any path to improve existing code;
- Sometimes tutorials/articles assume *all you are doing is software dev* and don't recognise that this is being balanced against other research work;
- Sometimes tutorials/articles are not tailored towards research project workflows.

To try to fill this gap, this session will hopefully:
- Introduce you to some practises/methods/tools that you can research further following the course;
- Provide *both* some good-practise workflows for starting a new research project, *as well as* some useful tools and advice for grappling with a pre-existing project;
- Instill the importance of good research computing practises, without overwhelming you to the point of sticking your head in the sand and avoiding it!
