#### 1. Create your environment yml file

In `{repo_name}/environment.yml`, add the following content (replacing the dependencies with
those you need for your specific project):

```yml
name: {repo_name}-dev

dependencies:
# These dependencies are very useful for packaging and testing your code
  - python=3.12
  - pytest
  - setuptools
  - blackd
  - isort
# Remove these/replace these ones:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - pandas
```
#### 2. Create your env from the yml file

You can now create the conda environment `{repo_name}-dev`:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

#### 3. Export your env exactly

At a future point in time (for example, after completing benchmarking, when creating a release etc.) you may want to export your exact conda env, including every dependency and version. This can be done using the `export` command (changing `env-record.yml` to a filename of your choosing):

```bash
conda env export > env-record.yml
```

This file will contain the exact versions of all your dependencies (including pip dependencies, and build information) which is a useful record, but isn't user-friendly when it comes to rebuilding/reproducing an environment. See the notes below on environment files and distributing code to see alternative export methods.

### Using `pytest`

The[`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/explanation/anatomy.html#test-anatomy) documentation suggests that each test has four parts:

1. Arrange: you set the test up; you define variables/example data.
2. Act: you run the functions you want to test.
3. Assert: you check the answers to these functions are expected.
4. Clean-up: you wipe the board clean and delete any variables or outputs.

These tests will go into your `test` directory, in a Python file that begins with `test_`, and are essentially functions who's names also begin with `test_` - this means that `pytest` will be able to find and identify them as tests. Whew, the word "test" has almost lost meaning by now.

In practise, a test might look like this:

```python
def test_example(self):
    '''Test for the example function'''
    
    # Arrange
    test_variable_1 = 0
    test_variable_2 = 1
    expected_output = 7

    # Act
    output = your_function(test_variable_1, test_variable_2)

    # Assert
    assert output == expected_output

    # No cleanup needed
```

- You can use a basic assert statement to check if output is identical, eg. `assert one == 1`.
- For floating point numbers of values where tolerance is required, you can use the `pytest.approx()` function -- see [documentation here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/reference.html#pytest.approx); remember that this will require an import statement like `from pytest import approx` at the beginning of your test script. You can define tolerance to suit your approach.
- The `math` library also includes a `isclose()` function -- see [documentation here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose).
- The `numpy.testing` module contains many different assert statements for arrays -- see [documentation here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.testing.html).

> First, sketch pseudocode for your tests.
> 
> - If given a specific input, what specific output do you expect?
> - What are some weird, edge cases that might trip your code up?
> - How might you separate out code-testing vs. scientific validation?
> - Are you matching integers with `==`, or will you have to include tolerances?
> - Do you need to import any external libraries into your test script, like `pytest` or `numpy`?
> 
> Run your tests. Can you break your code so a test fails?
