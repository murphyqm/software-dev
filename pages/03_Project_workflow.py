#### 1. Create your environment yml file

In `{repo_name}/environment.yml`, add the following content (replacing the dependencies with
those you need for your specific project):

```yml
name: {repo_name}-dev

dependencies:
# These dependencies are very useful for packaging and testing your code
  - python=3.12
  - pytest
  - setuptools
  - blackd
  - isort
# Remove these/replace these ones:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - pandas
```
#### 2. Create your env from the yml file

You can now create the conda environment `{repo_name}-dev`:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

#### 3. Export your env exactly

At a future point in time (for example, after completing benchmarking, when creating a release etc.) you may want to export your exact conda env, including every dependency and version. This can be done using the `export` command (changing `env-record.yml` to a filename of your choosing):

```bash
conda env export > env-record.yml
```

This file will contain the exact versions of all your dependencies (including pip dependencies, and build information) which is a useful record, but isn't user-friendly when it comes to rebuilding/reproducing an environment. See the notes below on environment files and distributing code to see alternative export methods.
